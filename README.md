- Volumentals responsive header
  
  The menu should work on all screen sizes.
  
  It should have a logotype and navigational links. 

  Hero background video
  
  A large cover video in the hero section adjusted for different screen formats.

Have a quick look at the Volumental website in the inspector tool before you start to better inherit design elements to your design. How much margin do they have on the page? What are their headings? Font sizes? And how does this change on mobile and tablet? 

You'll find an index.html and style.css file in the code folder of this repository to get started with.

### ü§ù Teamwork

We have invited Charlotte Andersson as a guest lecturer in agile and scrum. She will give you tools in how you best divide your work and work together in your teams. One of the challenges in this project is to learn how to work as a team. As a web developer this is something you do on a daily basis.

We suggest trying "mob programming". Mob programming is where one person is in control of a computer and is in charge of writing code, and the rest of the team is the mind - they tell the person typing what to type. As a team, you work towards a common goal. Then, every 15-20 minutes, you change who's in control of the computer (or switch computers).

### üñá Git & GitHub

Working as a team on GitHub takes some getting used to. If two members of your team edit code in the same file in the project and push the code to GitHub, there's a fair chance you'll run into a situation where your code conflicts. You'll have to solve the conflicts as a team and think of your teammates when committing code. **Committing small changes, very regularly makes it MUCH easier to handle conflicts**. Really - commit early and often.

When you do encounter a conflict, don't panic! Follow the [steps here](https://gist.github.com/ccannon94/a75f1f725d33a1834dd7f5feebbc7d4b) to resolve the conflict and then commit the fixed code.
