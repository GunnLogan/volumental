# Sprint 1: Team Project Group 2 ‚Äì Bauer

## Create Feature Pages for Volumental's Clients

For your first ever sprint project you will be challenged by the fast growing start-up Volumental to improve an important part of their webpage ‚Äì their client pages. 

Volumental‚Äôs mission is to transform the footwear industry, enabling a completely personalised experience in fitting and finding the perfect footwear. Volumental combines the world's fastest high accuracy 3D foot scanning system for retail, with an advanced AI driven 'Fit Engine' that generates highly personalised footwear recommendations.

Developed in Stockholm, Sweden, the Volumental solution drives sales, increases customer satisfaction and provides detailed data for research and development. Working with partners such as New Balance, Bauer and Ecco, the Volumental scanning solution is used across the globe.

### Your task
Currently their customers are listed on a [single page website.](https://www.volumental.com/partners/) Once the customer portfolio grows they would like to create separate feature pages for their biggest clients. Your assignment will be to create a stand alone page for the Volumental website dedicated to one of their customers. 

Your group will work with **Bauer** 

##  How to complete this project

### The page

Components your one-pager should have:

#### Responsive header
The menu should be Volumental's exisiting, try copy to your best ability. The menu should work on all screen sizes. 

#### Hero background image
A large top cover image or video in the hero section that works on all devices.

#### Information section
A short brief about the customer and link to their webpage. 

#### A grid
A Rresponsive grid with either images, text or both that shows their collaboration. 

#### Footer
A navigational footer with social media links.

Each group will be working on 1 customer page. You'll find **all relevant assets** for your customer in the repository. Make sure to edit photos to be in a good format and size.

###  ü§ù Teamwork

We have invited Charlotte Andersson as a guest lecturer in agile and scrum. She will give you tools in how you best divide your work and work together in your teams. One of the challenges in this project is to learn how to work as a team. As a web developer this is something you do on a daily basis.

We suggest trying "mob programming". Mob programming is where one person is in control of a computer and is in charge of writing code, and the rest of the team is the mind - they tell the person typing what to type. As a team, you work towards a common goal. Then, every 15-20 minutes, you change who's in control of the computer (or switch computers).

###  üñá Git & GitHub

Working as a team on GitHub takes some getting used to. If two members of your team edit code in the same file in the project and push the code to GitHub, there's a fair chance you'll run into a situation where your code conflicts. You'll have to solve the conflicts as a team and think of your teammates when committing code. **Committing small changes, very regularly makes it MUCH easier to handle conflicts**. Really - commit and early and often and don't forget to push them to Github.

When you do encounter a conflict, don't panic! Follow the [steps here](https://gist.github.com/ccannon94/a75f1f725d33a1834dd7f5feebbc7d4b) to resolve the conflict and then commit the fixed code.

### üí• BOOM: Success!

After completing this project, you should be comfortable with working as a team in a web project, know how to build a responsive webpage from scratch, build modules you can typically find on any webpage, like responsive menu, grid sections, hero images and footer.
